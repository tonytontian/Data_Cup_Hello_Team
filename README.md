Repo for Data cup 2018 held by desjardins. We are team hello

Challenge description

Amongst many other businesses, Desjardins has a prominent credit card offering. In fact, it is the 1st largest emitter of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Quebec and the 6th in Canada. This transpired in a business volume of over 35 billion dollars in 2017. With over a million credit card clients, the impact Desjardins has on the financial well-being of individuals, families and communities across the country is consequently immeasurable.

With this in mind, it is important for Desjardins to be constantly improving how it responds to the financial needs of its members and clients. To enable its clients to better manage their credit, Desjardins Card Services would like to implement a behavioral prediction model. This model would analyze a client?s billing, payment and transactional histories and would make a prediction as to whether a client is likely to be delinquent on their payments in the coming year.

Beyond the pure prediction (AUROC) score, the ideal solution would be feasibly deployed to production and would be combined with other internal scores and factors to provide a more complete picture of a client?s financial situation. This solution could eventually influence decisions on how new credit is granted to clients, determine how existing credit is treated and better personalize which products and services are offered.

Desjardins Card Services currently employs many statistical models, algorithms and technological innovations to help gauge their clients financial health. While many smart people work there to ameliorate accessibility to credit, there are many more who are elsewhere and with which they would like to collaborate with. They are now challenging Data Cup participants come up with new techniques to advance the state of risk modelling and to empower Canadians through a sounder management of their credit!
